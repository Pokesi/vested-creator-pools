  * @dev implementation of the {basic Vested Creator Pool} or {bVCP} specifications
  * with gas cost solution #1
  *
  * From the whitepaper:
  *
  * "A Creator Pool [...] is a royalties model which works more as a pay check,
  * rather than a constant stream of income. The basic idea behind this model
  * is that royalties do not go directly to the creator, instead, royalties are
  * sent to a pool. This pool gets emptied out in intervals, and every NFT
  * collectionâ€™s creator is paid out in proportion to what they contributed."
