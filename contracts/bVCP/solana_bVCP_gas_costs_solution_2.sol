  * @dev implementation of the {basic Vested Creator Pool} or {bVCP} specifications
  * with gas cost solution #2
  *
  * From the whitepaper:
  *
  * "A Creator Pool [...] is a royalties model which works more as a pay check,
  * rather than a constant stream of income. The basic idea behind this model
  * is that royalties do not go directly to the creator, instead, royalties are
  * sent to a pool. This pool gets emptied out in intervals, and every NFT
  * collectionâ€™s creator is paid out in proportion to what they contributed."

/**
  * This is different to the EVM-compatiable contract, because on Solana, sending
  * value on CPI's isn't allowed. So we need to permission the deposit function,
  * only allowing some addresses to modify the amount that has to be paid out to
  * the creator.
  *
  * The way this works is:
  *  - NFT gets bought for 100 SOL @ 5% royalty
  *  - Marketplace contract sends 5 SOL to the bVCP
  *  - Marketplace contract calls deposit(address,uint64), uint64 being the
  *    royalty amount
  * Permissioning the deposit() call makes sure this can only be called by the
  * marketplace contract and in this order.
