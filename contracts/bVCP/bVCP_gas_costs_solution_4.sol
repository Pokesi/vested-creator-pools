  * @dev implementation of the {basic Vested Creator Pool} or {bVCP} specifications

  *
  * @notice In this case, claiming a creator's royalties awards the claimer 0.5%
  * of those funds.
  *
  * From the whitepaper:
  *
  * "A Creator Pool [...] is a royalties model which works more as a pay check,
  * rather than a constant stream of income. The basic idea behind this model
  * is that royalties do not go directly to the creator, instead, royalties are
  * sent to a pool. This pool gets emptied out in intervals, and every NFT
  * collectionâ€™s creator is paid out in proportion to what they contributed."
