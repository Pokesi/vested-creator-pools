  * @dev implementation of the {invested Individually Capped Vested Creator Pool or {iCVCP} specifications
  * with gas cost solution #1
  *
  * From the whitepaper:
  *
  * "A Creator Pool [...] is a royalties model which works more as a pay check,
  * rather than a constant stream of income. The basic idea behind this model
  * is that royalties do not go directly to the creator, instead, royalties are
  * sent to a pool. This pool gets emptied out in intervals, and every NFT
  * collectionâ€™s creator is paid out in proportion to what they contributed."

  /**
    * This is different to the EVM-compatiable contract, because on Solana, sending
    * value on CPI's isn't allowed. So we need to permission the deposit function,
    * only allowing some addresses to modify the amount that has to be paid out to
    * the creator.
    *
    * The way this works is:
    *  - NFT gets bought for 100 SOL @ 5% royalty
    *  - Marketplace contract sends 5 SOL to the bVCP
    *  - Marketplace contract calls deposit(address,uint64), uint64 being the
    *    royalty amount
    * Permissioning the deposit() call makes sure this can only be called by the
    * marketplace contract and in this order.

/**
  *  A depositer contract is a helper contract that has a deposit() external
  *  function and a withdraw() external function.
  *
  *  The deposit() function deposits the amount specified to the strategy,
  *  using funds sent prior (because no value w/ CPI on solana)
  *
  *  The withdraw() function just removes all the funds from that same strategy,
  *  and sends it back to the contracy. This function should be permissioned to
  *  only allow pools to use it, or else anyone could force a withdraw.
