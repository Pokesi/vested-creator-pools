  * @dev implementation of the {invested Vested Creator Pool} or {iVCP} specifications

  *
  * From the whitepaper:
  *
  * "A Creator Pool [...] is a royalties model which works more as a pay check,
  * rather than a constant stream of income. The basic idea behind this model
  * is that royalties do not go directly to the creator, instead, royalties are
  * sent to a pool. This pool gets emptied out in intervals, and every NFT
  * collectionâ€™s creator is paid out in proportion to what they contributed."

/**
  *  A depositer contract is a helper contract that has a deposit() external
  *  function and a withdraw() external function.
  *
  *  The deposit() function is payable, and uses any Ether sent, and deposits it
  *  into a strategy (Yearn vault, LP, etc.).
  *
  *  The withdraw() function just removes all the funds from that same strategy,
  *  and sends it back to the contracy. This function should be permissioned to
  *  only allow pools to use it, or else anyone could force a withdraw.
